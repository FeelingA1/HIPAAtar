                    <h3>Plan Your Recipes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adapt recipes to fit your needs. A diabetes care and education specialist can customize your diabetes diet for your specific needs. Choosing meals that help manage your blood sugar is key to managing your diabetes. If you love pasta dishes, but your diabetes meal plan has you following a low-carb diet, you can search recipes that use veggie noodles instead of traditional noodles. These are great alternatives to increase your vegetable intake and keep your blood sugar from spiking.</li>
                            <li>Use recipes with common ingredients. Using the same ingredients for multiple meals doesn’t mean they all have to taste the same. Using different herbs and spices can turn common ingredients into meals with different flavors. If your favorite protein is chicken, cook one whole chicken and use it for several different dishes. You can have chicken and vegetable stir fry one night and chicken fajitas another night.</li>

                    <h3>Shop With a List</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once you’ve planned your meals for the week, create a shopping list with the ingredients you need. Having a shopping list makes shopping easier and faster, which helps you reduce impulse buys and take home only the items you need. It also helps you avoid extra trips to the grocery store to buy forgotten items.</li>
                            <li>If your shopping list includes nuts, beans, or grains, consider buying in bulk to save money and keep your pantry well-stocked for future meal planning.</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Buy Store Brands</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Buying generic or store brand items can save you 20% to 30% on your food bill. Items like canned tomatoes, milk, olive oil, and frozen fruits and vegetables are usually available in a cheaper store brand version.</li>
                            <li>Just be sure to compare the ingredients list and nutrition facts panel to make sure you’re not getting a product with added ingredients. Learning which store brands your grocery store carries can help you reduce your total at the cash register.</li>
