The Messages page is broken up into several components:
Messages.js: The messages page (displays other components)
Messaging.js: The host component rendered by the Messages page
    hosts MessageList and MessageForm componenets as well as handles 
    new messages
MessageList.js: List of messages already sent/received and are displayed on screen
MessageForm.js: Handles typing and sending messages
Message.js: Structure representing a specific message with author, body, and boolean if "I" sent the message
Also various .css files for styling

Biggest features to implement going forward:
1. Networking such that users can send messages back and forth with each other.
    Right now this is just framework and UI. Messages are sent nowhere except to be displayed on screen.
    Also messages are lost after navigating away from the page.
    This would best be accomplished by holding the messages on the backend database and posting/retreiving from said database
    for every message to populate MessageList component.

2. Transitioning messages to the backend:
    explained above

3. Styling:
    Use the .css files to make this more attractive
