                <li>Be consistent. Go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning, including on the weekends</li>
                <li>Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperatur</li>
                <li>Remove electronic devices, such as TVs, computers, and smart phones, from the bedroom</li>
                <li>Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime</li>
                <li>Get some exercise. Being physically active during the day can help you fall asleep more easily at night.</li>
                <li>Set a bedtime that is early enough for you to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep.</li>
                <li>If you donâ€™t fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed. Go do a quiet activity without a lot of light exposure. It is especially important to not get on electronics.</li>
