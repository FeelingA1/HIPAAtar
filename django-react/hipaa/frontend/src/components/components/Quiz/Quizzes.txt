The Quizzes page is broken up into multiple components:
Quizzes.js: Quizzes page on site, just displays the Quiz component
Quiz.js: Major quiz component handling quiz functionality including:
    Fetching questions from the banks
    Replaying quiz
    Playing the next quiz
    Scoring quiz
    Validating user answers
    Displaying SelectionBar/QuestionBox/ResultBox
QuestionBanks: Multiple dummy question banks to represent 3 different quizzes 
    along with an exported function to pull 5 random questions from the banks
QuestionBox.js: Handles displaying the questions and answers
SelectionBar.js: Handles displaying the specific quiz based on quiz number/name
ResultBox.js: Shows quiz score after finishing with a play again and next quiz button

Biggest features to implement going forward:

1. Styling

2. Creating real quizzes (replace dummy quizzes with usable quizzes)

3. Connect quizzes to corresponding tips on tips page (Probably in result box)
